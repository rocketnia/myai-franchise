## Mega Mega Megan

#### Plot

A young girl (Megan) has a hobby of physically bullying her brother, but their parents satiate her with video games to keep her violence contained. One day, she and her brother are playing link:bibi-chan.asc[Bibi-chan], a wholesome game of civic duty in a robot animal empire. Mysteriously, the two of them are sucked into the game.

Megan is overjoyed. Nobody's ever told her to be nice to robots, so she murders them freely. Soon she comes upon the dutiful delivery bot Bibi-chan herself, and soon Bibi-chan is a pile of scrap and Megan is wearing a new outfit: A pink jumpsuit with yellow goggles that look all too familiar.

Megan's brother lands elsewhere in the empire.

Megan's brother's name... Roi Ron? Sir Tristan? Duke? Baron Aaron? Aaron puns with lots of things: scarin', blarin', carin', sharin', barren....

Baron Darren!

The game has basically three acts:

Queen Ratched has Derren captured, and she tries to use him as leverage to stop Megan's rampage.

In a climactic battle where Darren is used as a bargaining chip, Megan is about to win.
