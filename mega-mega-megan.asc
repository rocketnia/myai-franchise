## Mega Mega Megan

#### Plot

*Megan* is a young girl with a hobby of physically bullying her brother *Darren*. Their parents satiate her with video games to keep her violence contained. One day, she and Darren are playing link:bibi-chan.asc[Bibi-chan], a wholesome game of civic duty in a robot animal empire. Mysteriously, the two of them are sucked into the game.

Megan is overjoyed. Nobody's ever told her to be nice to robots, so she feels no remorse in going on a robot murdering spree. Soon she comes upon the dutiful delivery bot Bibi-chan herself, and soon Bibi-chan is a pile of scrap and Megan is wearing a new outfit: A pink jumpsuit with Bibi-chan's trademark yellow goggles.

Darren lands elsewhere in the empire, where he soon gets rounded up by the local authorities. He tries to explain his situation, but nobody seems to take him very seriously. That is, until Queen Ratched catches wind that Darren is related to the "Mega Mega Megan" that has been terrorizing her empire. Her Majesty decides to hold Darren captive and try to bait Megan into rescuing him.

Megan has none of that. She continues on her rampage, and even when the Queen strategically guides her to go on a certain _kind_ of rampage, Megan doesn't behave according to the plan. Threats to Darren have little if any effect on Megan.

Eventually Queen Ratched stages a battle where Darren is on the sidelines in a cage. Megan once again starts acting in a way that isn't quite conducive to Queen Ratched's plan, but Darren is crafty, and he sabotages the battle himself. He causes a hole to open up in the ground so that Megan falls in.

Queen Ratched begins to see Darren as a curious ally, and she gives him a rank: "Baron Darren." The two of them strategize while Megan makes her way out of her current predicament.

Trapped underground, Megan gets to deal with the inner workings that support the small-town atmosphere above: Lava flows that lead into iron smelting factories, prisoner camps with forced labor, postal warehouses, greenhouses, oil drilling rigs, robot R&D facilities, nightclubs. Downtown. Robots from above the surface regularly commute through here and work here, but most of them manage to put this part of the world out of their mind.

Megan doesn't care. She'll rampage through here too.

Darren wants to use his new authority to turn the tables on Megan for all the abuse she's given him throughout their lives. At times, he's even more vindictive against Megan than Queen Ratched really wants to support. He also has a sour opinion of certain leadership practices in the empire. After a few times having his plans turned down by Queen Ratched, he becomes paranoid that once the Queen has Megan handled, she'll come after him next.

Queen Ratched, who's not even thinking that far ahead yet, finds herself betrayed by an opportunistic Darren. Now she's out of the picture as well, and Darren wears her clothes and gains her mysterious powers of authority.

Megan forges a connection between Uptown and Downtown, in her own destructive way, and she begins to pass freely between them. On her return to the surface, she finds actual _support_ from some of the local authorities, who see her as a way to usurp King Darren. King Darren has been ruling with an oddly lenient policy, refusing to take responsibility for the failures of those under him, and rewarding leaders who show the same behavior.

Megan eventually confronts King Darren in a face-to-face battle. When they fight, Megan and Darren trigger a special power that sucks people into story artifacts like the game cartridge they're in. Megan defeats Darren, stripping him of Queen Ratched's clothes and trapping him in a story in her own imagination. (TODO: Design that one.) Without an owner to wear them, Queen Ratched's clothes bring her back to life, and she takes back the reigns of the empire.

Megan goes on to battle through Queen Ratched's volcano fortress. At the top of the volcano, Queen Ratched has prepared a fleet of flying saucer bots, which Megan must navigate high above the pit of lava. This is the site of their final battle.

In a twist, their final battle has some odd robots (link:anthology-plot.asc[Yeoman and Shinx]) as spectators. Not only that, but a villain (link:README.asc[Chaozer]) unzips a hole in the sky and abducts Megan on the spot. Chaozer doesn't stop to chat, and just goes back where he came.

Yeoman tries to chase Chaozer but can't catch up. Instead, he looks over to Queen Ratched floating idly, having no purpose to her story anymore. He hollers to Queen Ratched, calling himself a version of Mega Mega Megan from the future. He waves link:README.asc[Magical Radia]'s rod and inspires the flying saucer bots to form a rebellion against Queen Ratched. Then he goes back to talk to Shinx, and the two of them disappear in an explosion.

#### Gameplay

TODO

#### Unstructured gameplay notes

Power-ups are highlighted by orbiting sparkles, and they magnetize to Megan when she gets near. These sparkles are actually manufactured in a Downtown factory, where they also orbit enemies and bombs.

Uptown has a land with teacup rides (moving platforms), but they're not really for tea, nor coffee. They're for oil. (Robots, you know.) Downtown has similar contraptions, but they're actually filled with hot oil and sometimes molten iron.

When Megan returns to Uptown, some regions are overrun with too many enemies. Destroying a Downtown factory will take care of that.
