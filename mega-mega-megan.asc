## Mega Mega Megan

#### Plot

*Megan* is a young girl with a hobby of physically bullying her brother *Darren*. Their parents satiate her with video games to keep her violence contained. One day, she and Darren are playing link:bibi-chan.asc[Bibi-chan], a wholesome game of civic duty in a robot animal empire. Mysteriously, the two of them are sucked into the game.

Megan is overjoyed. Nobody's ever told her to be nice to robots, so she feels no remorse in going on a robot murdering spree. Soon she comes upon the dutiful delivery bot Bibi-chan herself, and soon Bibi-chan is a pile of scrap and Megan is wearing a new outfit: A pink jumpsuit with Bibi-chan's trademark yellow goggles.

Darren lands elsewhere in the empire, where he soon gets rounded up by the local authorities. He tries to explain his situation, but nobody seems to take him very seriously. That is, until Queen Ratched catches wind that Darren is related to the "Mega Mega Megan" that has been terrorizing her empire. Her Majesty decides to hold Darren captive and try to bait Megan into rescuing him.

Megan has none of that. She continues on her rampage, and even when the Queen strategically guides her to go on a certain _kind_ of rampage, Megan doesn't behave according to the plan. Threats to Darren have little if any effect on Megan.

Eventually Queen Ratched stages a battle where Darren is on the sidelines in a cage. Megan once again starts acting in a way that isn't quite conducive to Queen Ratched's plan, but Darren is crafty, and he sabotages the battle himself. He causes a hole to open up in the ground so that Megan falls in.

Queen Ratched begins to see Darren as a curious ally, and she gives him a rank: "Baron Darren." The two of them strategize while Megan makes her way out of her current predicament.

Trapped underground, Megan gets to deal with the inner workings that support the small-town atmosphere above: Lava flows that lead into iron smelting factories, prisoner camps with forced labor, postal warehouses, greenhouses, oil drilling rigs, robot R&D facilities, nightclubs. Downtown. Robots from above the surface regularly commute through here and work here, but most of them manage to put this part of the world out of their mind.

Megan doesn't care. She'll rampage through here too.
