MyAI
====

This project is link:anthology-plot.asc[a story]. In fact, it's a whole anthology's worth of stories. In fact, the anthology involves hopping between various story worlds, which each have their own individual stories too.

The main characters
-------------------

*Celeprater* is a purple turtle-shaped creature that we're all glad to see. It was here the whole time, of course. Don't be silly.

*Milly* is an actress who reads dirty fanfic and has a way with food. She likes to take pictures of memorable events, especially on her VR adventures with Lilly.

*Lilly* is a domestic spy who sometimes brushes with a sex addiction. Her energy to go on fast-paced adventures is good for her spycraft, but even better for her VR escapism.

*Yeoman* is a robot who literally fell out of the sky one day. He wonders where he came from and where he's going, but somehow he has the robot power to open portals between story worlds.

*Max* is a deep admirer of fictional characters, whose uncanny luck makes him bitter that he barely gets any real challenge in life. His luck is sufficient to construct outrageously advanced technology by accident, such as the generally intelligent *MyAI*.

*Ian* (under the code name *Mary* or *Gary*) is a narcissistic VR user. Unsatisfied with manipulating the fabric of reality, he or she strives to win characters' hearts and minds as well.

*Marie* (under the code name *Sue*) is a VR user who enjoys the cathartic release of destroying fictional representations of the things she doesn't like.

*Shinx* is a twin of Yeoman, similarly amnesiatic, who believes that his life's meaning can be found in helping stories along to their natural resolution. He is more than willing to play the part of the grim reaper in this process.

*Magical Radia* is the eponymous protagonist of a TV show. As per the TV show's sense of humor and semi-educational intentions, she can break the fourth wall to speak about the "real world" where that show is made, but her fellow characters are too in-character to notice. (That "real world" is fictional too, from the perspective of you and me.)

*Bibi-chan* is the eponymous protagonist of link:bibi-chan.asc[a puzzle video game]. She's a simple messenger droid who cooperates with the cute robot residents of *Queen Ratched*'s empire to ameliorate various logistical issues affecting their society.

*Mega Mega Megan* is the eponymous protagonist of link:mega-mega-megan.asc[an action video game and TV show phenomenon]. The premise of this franchise is that a violent teenage gamer enters a game called "Bibi-chan" and wreaks havoc.

*Chaozer* is the melodramatic villain who jumps to the "real world" to destroy the universe from the outside. Once there, he jumps to the _real_ "real world" to destroy the first "real world" from the outside, and so on _ad infinitum_. The story-hopping story is told in link:mega-mega-megan.asc[Story about That].

*Love*, *Shack*, and *Baby* are one trine of characters in link:goody-goody-goodies.asc[the world of "Goody-Goody Goodies," "Wishy-Washy Wishes," and "Baddy-Baddy Baddies."] This trine is among the trines responsible for developing goodun-badun distillation technology, escaping the planet, and unleashing the Goody-Baddy feud upon the spiraling branches of the galactic orrery complex.


The point
---------

Since this is a project in development, *turn back now* if you don't want to see *spoilers* or if you don't want to know the *author's intent*.

My goals for MyAI are rather modest relative to the sheer volume of the project:

* Have fun.

* See if I can learn a thing or two about myself. Since high school (or even earlier), I've been pondering these characters as a way to explore my self-identity.

* Explore these themes:

** The various relationships people have with fictional characters.

** What people might do when they have power limited only by their imagination.

This repository exists so I have a place to put my notes. Specifically, NaNoWriMo 2014 has provided the impetus to set this up.
