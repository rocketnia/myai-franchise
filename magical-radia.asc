## Magical Radia

(TODO: So far, this is not a blank-slate introduction to Magical Radia. It's just some in-progress notes I'm writing to organize an interactive story featuring Erisa as the player character. I should organize this into a blank-slate introduction at some point.)

(TODO: Link to this from README.asc.)

#### Consistent mechanics

Magical Radia herself has a sort of consistent mechanic: She can take things apart with her political magic. She can also break the fourth wall.

Magical Robbie has a sort of consistent mechanic: His magic can put things together.

Fromara has two layers of potential consistent mechanics: On the surface, she's extremely rich. In secret, she's a force of evil.

At Natureville High, Radia and Fromara hang out with Erisa and Yuhie.

Erisa is a fangirl goofball, and I'm interested in using her as the main character of a work of IF. In her free time, she seeds torrents of her favorite TV shows.

Yuhie is laid-back, usually tired in the mornings, but somehow winds up being landed with the responsibility for things. All the better that she's a responsible person, then. She's the first of their group to explain why something they did is silly, as though she's teaching them a lesson rather than just encouraging them.

In terms of personality, Fromara is soft-spoken but usually speaks things that are harsher than her tone would suggest. She's willing to flaunt her money, and she uses money as a motivator for other people -- not always in the form of bribes, but in the form of unemployment-shaming and such.

In terms of personality, Radia is frazzled. She keeps her Magical Radia identity mostly on the down-low in public, even after her friends figure it out, and she has to balance school and hero life. What the characters don't know is that she's also balancing her own feelings with the needs of the Magical Radia TV show that they're all characters in. She's afraid that if she makes a misstep, the show will be cancelled. She deals with all this stress by making snarky jokes.

Magical Robbie, when he's out in the field using his powers, is aloof and condescending. At school, Robbie blends in as one of the fan club of the cutest boy in class, Kazuki. Other fans show their feelings with love letters or shows of strength. Robbie steals the show with masterfully prepared lunch cuisine, paintings, etc. The other fans just pass it off as something Robbie does, and they don't consider him a serious contender for Kazuki's attention.

Kazuki himself adores the spotlight, and he accepts all the boys' offerings with absolute gratitude. He declares that he's saving himself for Magical Robbie -- entirely unaware that Robbie is among his fans -- but he clearly only says this to put himself in a league above everyone. Kazuki is not insensitive, and when the situation calls for it, he uses his popularity for the benefit of anyone who really needs some help.

So, with all of that out of the way, what could Erisa have as her consistent mechanics, to support a satisfying IF storyline?
