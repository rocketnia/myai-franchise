## Magical Radia

(TODO: So far, this is not a blank-slate introduction to Magical Radia. It's just some in-progress notes I'm writing to organize an interactive story featuring Erisa as the player character. I should organize this into a blank-slate introduction at some point.)

(TODO: Link to this from README.asc.)

#### Consistent mechanics

Magical Radia herself has a sort of consistent mechanic: She can take things apart with her political magic. She can also break the fourth wall.

Magical Robbie has a sort of consistent mechanic: His magic can put things together.

Fromara has two layers of potential consistent mechanics: On the surface, she's extremely rich. In secret, she's a force of evil.

At Natureville High, Radia and Fromara hang out with Erisa and Yuhie.

Erisa is a fangirl goofball, and I'm interested in using her as the main character of a work of IF. In her free time, she seeds torrents of her favorite TV shows.

Yuhie is laid-back, usually tired in the mornings, but somehow winds up being landed with the responsibility for things. All the better that she's a responsible person, then. She's the first of their group to explain why something they did is silly, as though she's teaching them a lesson rather than just encouraging them.

In terms of personality, Fromara is soft-spoken but usually speaks things that are harsher than her tone would suggest. She's willing to flaunt her money, and she uses money as a motivator for other people -- not always in the form of bribes, but in the form of unemployment-shaming and such.

In terms of personality, Radia is frazzled. She keeps her Magical Radia identity mostly on the down-low in public, even after her friends figure it out, and she has to balance school and hero life. What the characters don't know is that she's also balancing her own feelings with the needs of the Magical Radia TV show that they're all characters in. She's afraid that if she makes a misstep, the show will be cancelled. She deals with all this stress by making snarky jokes.

Magical Robbie, when he's out in the field using his powers, is aloof and condescending. At school, Robbie blends in as one of the fan club of the cutest boy in class, Kazuki. Other fans show their feelings with love letters or shows of strength. Robbie steals the show with masterfully prepared lunch cuisine, paintings, etc. The other fans just pass it off as something Robbie does, and they don't consider him a serious contender for Kazuki's attention.

Kazuki himself adores the spotlight, and he accepts all the boys' offerings with absolute gratitude. He declares that he's saving himself for Magical Robbie -- entirely unaware that Robbie is among his fans -- but he clearly only says this to put himself in a league above everyone. Kazuki is not insensitive, and when the situation calls for it, he uses his popularity for the benefit of anyone who really needs some help.

So, with all of that out of the way, what could Erisa have as her consistent mechanics, to support a satisfying IF storyline?

Erisa's most powerful assets are her friends. Her friends are also much more potent sources of drama than she is; she'll shirk anything off with a goofy expression on her face. So, Erisa's motivations are mostly altruistic, and her methods are mostly manipulative. On a more direct level, she acts playfully and makes jokes; when she gets something on her mind, it can become her whole world for a while.

Instead of letting this get out of hand with multitudes of combinations and sequences of (choose an NPC's mission to be altruistic toward) and (choose a mode of playfulness) and (choose an NPC to seek help from), let's make this a kishoutenketsu structure. Yonkoma makes sense as a metaphor for Erisa's way of life anyway.

Day 1: Ki: Introduce the characters and establish their everyday routine.
Day 2: Shou: The characters' "everyday routine" usually mixes up the routine in some way. Show an example of how the status quo is typically challenged and restored. Erisa's choices on this day matter more than it seems.
Day 3: Ten: Erisa's prior actions have gotten out of hand. Even at the end of the day, things aren't like they were before.
Day 4: Ketsu: The characters get used to the new state of things. Some bubbles of dramatic pressure are released, and some others are created. This begins a new status quo.

Let's get into more detail.

A typical day for Magical Radia is actually a multi-act structure of its own. First, school begins for the day, and some innocent conversations begin. Second, some personal conflict arises between the characters, but an Incarnation attack means Magical Radia has to go save the day. After a battle over the Incarnation with Magical Robbie, Radia has learned some valuable lesson about politics. The personal conflict is raised again, but the characters can settle it this time.

The Incarnation monsters have an elegant appearance, and they're themed according to various ideals and platitudes that have political sway: Hope, hard work, independence, community, backbone, discussion, ongoing legacy, responsibility, integrity, mercy, courage, caregiving, completion, respect, sentimentality, and so on. The Incarnations' values seep into the people they are near, and Magical Radia has the unique ability to isolate the incarnation again and separate it from the people it infected.

Magical Robbie believes that the Incarnations should be allowed to spread, and he has the unique ability to blur the lines and make it unclear which part of the situation is due to the Incarnation and which part is more original.

Erisa has several ways she can try to spin this situation:

* She can try to help Magical Radia and Fromara get together.
* She can try to help Magical Radia and Magical Robbie get together.
* She can try to help Kazuki and Magical Robbie get together.
* She can try to make friends with Kazuki's fan club.
* She can try to get together with Yuhie.
* She can try to cultivate Fromara's hidden evil.
* She can try to help Magical Radia save the day from the Incarnations.
* She can try to hinder Magical Radia's attempts to save the day from the Incarnations (perhaps by helping Magical Robbie instead).
* She can try to orchestrate a chain reaction of hilarity (at least four dramatic events that lead into each other suddenly).

Not all of these can be fully achieved. For instance, Radia just isn't going to fall in love with Robbie, even if the characters are supposed to fall in love and get married canonically. However, the narrative can at least acknowledge the attempt.

How about focusing on three possible climaxes:

* Climax 1: Due to Erisa's meddling, Kazuki finally gets to meet with Magical Robbie face-to-face.
** Outcome 1A: They fall for each other. Magical Radia starts to get flustered, wondering what will happen to the marriage arc. Radia's friends see her in this abrasive sort of confusion, and they think she's jealous. The fan club huddles together in tears, knowing that their love for Kazuki is now beyond feasible possibility.
** Outcome 1B: Kazuki reveals that he didn't really need Magical Robbie in his life after all. Robbie is frustrated and doesn't know what to do with his cover identity anymore.

* Climax 2: Due to Erisa's meddling, she herself gets kidnapped and gets possessed by an Incarnation.
** Outcome 2A: Erisa is saved by Magical Radia, and the resolution revolves around letting Erisa calm down from the excitement. Yuhie really does care!
** Outcome 2B: The possessed Erisa is so strong that she can't be stopped by Magical Radia. Does the Incarnation have Erisa's power, or does Erisa have its power?

* Climax 3: Due to Erisa's meddling, Fromara and Magical Radia have a fight, and they become enemies.
** Outcome 3A: Erisa helps them make up (in her usual way of acting innocent and getting others to help for her). Everyone shares a laugh about how hard it would be for Radia if she didn't have Fromara's money backing her.
** Outcome 3B: Erisa encourages Fromara on this path, and Fromara takes her in as a confidant as they drool over Fromara's box of Incarnations. Fromara has been using Magical Radia to collect Incarnations all along!

All the other ways to spin the situation are fun diversions. They will be acknowledged, and they may even have some resolution arcs, but they don't affect the main struggle of the story.

The break from status quo on day 2 (Shou)... What could that be? How about, Magical Radia has to *help* Robbie for once, because Robbie himself is under the influence of an Incarnation.

Now to choose one Incarnation to attack per day... While most attacks are somewhat arbitrary, reflecting the subconscious wants of the whole city of Natureville rather than just the main characters, I imagine that the Incarnation in day 3 should vary depending on the events of days 1 and 2. The fourth day's Incarnation may be more stable across timelines again, and certain paths may feature an incarnation in day 4 that would have appeared in day 3, so as to suggest that it was just pushed over the edge a little. Possible choices:

* Hard work: This could distract Magical Radia for a while as she has to do the hard work of battling it.

* Hope: The threat this poses is deceptively silly, just getting people to invest in risky ventures and such. At worst, it could catch Magical Radia off guard by encouraging her to settle on a strategy that was more risky than it needed to be. This is probably better as a silly day 1 rather than a silly day 4; on day 4 it would make the story feel really sappy and profound.

* Integrity: This one could threaten to reveal lots of the characters' secrets, and some characters would like to play this Incarnation against each other. This could be a great one for episode 2.

* Independence: This one could be a doozy. If this Incarnation infects people, it's sort of the same power that Magical Radia has herself. If it keeps to itself (true to character!), then it could be as capitalistic as Fromara. Anyone it affects could become self-interested and rebellious. People who have heavily specialized skills, who usually depend on community to cover their bases (e.g. food production) would suffer. This Incarnation is too powerful for this slice-of-life story; it's more appropriate as a pivotal moment in the overall story of Magical Radia.

* Community: The danger this one poses is that it forms cults, and it shames outlying people to set an example. This would be a good justification for Climax 1; if it bolsters the power of Kazuki's fan club, then Kazuki can come face-to-face with Magical Robbie.

* Backbone: Unlike Integrity, which encourages people to come clean, this Incarnation would be all about the pride of being right. It could cause conflicts to heighten. This could be a good one for episode 2, or for Climax 3.

* Discussion: This one would complicate the writing too much. It wouldn't reveal characters' secrets exactly, but it could get tiring and distract the reader toward an unimportant topic.

* Ongoing Legacy: This is about making an effort to establish a better world for future generations. It gets people to put aside their personal identity politics and life dreams and focus on more abstract concerns, like building infrastructure and reducing pollution. This is a potentially epic topic, but it would be characteristic of this Incarnation to burrow its way in and take a long time to neutralize, so it could make an appearance in this story.

* Responsibility: This is about correcting for past mistakes. Those affected by it feel guilty and hopeless. (TODO: Finish this description, finish the descriptions below, and add "Ongoing Legacy" and down to the chart below if they fit.)

* Mercy:

* Courage:

* Caregiving:

* Completion:

* Respect:

* Sentimentality:



* Day 1: ??? (Hope?)
* Day 2: ??? (Backbone? Integrity?)
* Day 3 Climax 1: ??? (Community!)
* Day 4 Outcome 1A: ???
* Day 4 Outcome 1B: ??? (Hard Work?)
* Day 3 Climax 2: ???
* Day 4 Outcome 2A: ??? (Hard Work?)
* Day 4 Outcome 2B: ??? (Hope?)
* Day 3 Climax 3: ??? (Backbone?)
* Day 4 Outcome 3A: ??? (Hard Work?)
* Day 4 Outcome 3B: ??? (Hope? Hard Work?)
