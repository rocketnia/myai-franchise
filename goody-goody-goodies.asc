## Goody-Goody Goodies

#### World

For thousands of eons, life has gone on. Life has built itself up to become the galactic orrery complex, a giant web of space elevators and Dyson spheres that adaptively harness the power of planets, stars, and black holes to provide power to its mechanical and maintenance infrastructure. Meanwhile, it constructs various experimental biospheres, planets, and planetary systems inhabited by humans, which it adaptively harnesses to provide its intelligence infrastructure.

On a certain planet, unaware of the galactic orrery complex, every person is given an alignment at birth: They're a goody, or they're a baddy. At this time, they're assigned to a trine of three babies of the same alignment, and the three babies are given simple names suiting their trine. Trines grow up as family, though usually with the help of a mature trine or two. Babies are also given a gauntlet that measures their subatomic goodun and badun affinity, which they wear throughout their lives. This objectivity helps keep goodies or baddies from pursuing philosophical equivocations that stage them as the superior side.

It's not infrequent for someone to have trouble maintaining their goodun-badun ratio according to their alignment, but this is often dismissed as economic hardship; the economy strongly favors those who have good scores on their gauntlets. Still, there are people who seek an alignment transition or who would like to reject the notion of alignment altogether. These people are called wishy-washies, and the ones who manage to make a living in spite of their condition (washies) are respected, especially in leadership positions which need to oversee both baddies and goodies fairly. Washies sometimes favor other wishy-washies inequitably or have sympathy for wishy aid programs, but they also try to keep this tendency in check. It's common sense idea that gooduns and baduns must stay in tense rivalry.

Young adults of ages 17-24 engage in sanctioned tomfoolery so that this subatomic rivalry can be cultivated. They go to live in isolated biospheres where goodies and baddies live in a well-mixed checkerboard of dwellings, with various manufactured temptations to pursue in between. Some regions of the biosphere are heavily forested, but others have more of a village, strip mall, or hard labor aesthetic. Participants are encouraged to form clubs to study any topics of interest to them, and they're especially encouraged to hold contests.

#### Things that are not in the world

Violence is never a problem. The people of this world have some amount of toon physics on their side. If they fall off a cliff, they'll find themselves walking around in a cast for a short while, and then they'll be good to go again.

There is no notion of masculinity or femininity, and all characters appear androgynous. The only third-person pronoun is "they," but repeating someone's name is preferred when possible. Names are chosen to be succinct enough to do this comfortably: Door, Hinge, and Jam, for instance.

Sexuality is not really part of the culture at all. Sex is something that can happen, but it's not something anyone would think to do -- not for pleasure, not for marketing, and not for harm. Even if someone discovered sexual stimulation by accident, they would soon mysteriously forget about it.

Precisely because of the lack of significance of gender and sex, sometimes characters do things that we in the audience would consider gendered or sexual. Our viewpoint imposes inevitable bias: Either the story silently stays within the boundaries of what we expect, or it's palatable to us, or it explicitly lampshades our viewpoint so that the events can continue being independent of it. Goody-Goody Goodies will tend to err toward the latter, without ever quite breaking the fourth wall.

#### Plot for part one, "Goody-Goody Goodies"

The story begins in a single biosphere, following some new arrivals as they begin their adventures. It's a lighthearted situation, with every victory and defeat mostly forgotten and forgiven by the next day.

Sooner or later, one trine manages to build a contraption that focuses and filters gooduns and baduns. They use this device to rewrite their own alliances at whim, cheating the economy of the biosphere. Government agencies begin to take interest, and the students leave the biosphere behind.

#### Plot for part two, "Wishy-Washy Wishes"

Outside the manufactured orderliness of the biosphere, revisiting the supposed orderliness of their homes and families, the students have to figure out who they can really trust. Some of them try to use the technology to aid wishies, and some work to reform the economic system to avoid this broken technology. Some take the opportunity of a changing economy to profit beyond their wildest dreams.

A certain ancient device gains a newfound interest: A button that was foretold to bring forth the end of the world if it were ever pressed. Nobody has ever managed to press it; anyone who tried would find themselves foiled by the silliest of interruptions and malfunctions. Over 200 years ago, the scientists Good and Bad had investigated this device and discovered the subatomic particles that would be named after them, gooduns and baduns. With this newfound level of control over these natural forces, the button can be studied in more detail.

#### Plot for part three, "Baddy-Baddy Battles"

The button has been pressed, and the result is chaos.

In an expanding radius of the button itself, gooduns and baduns are disappearing altogether. In the areas where they're gone, the laws of physics behave differently: Several eye-catching phenomena are seen to have complex, gradual shading and polygonal edges as opposed to the solid colors and smooth black contours that have been considered natural. Destruction and injuries that would have usually regenerated on their own are remaining permanently.

Despite the tragedy of this deterioration, goodies and baddies participate in their traditional holiday competitions... and this has a profound effect. It counteracts the deterioration! Before they know it, they're competing every day, almost putting aside their everyday needs to keep the world they love from falling apart. Leading this effort are the students and young people, since the adults have had enough life experience to understand wishy-washy values.

Meanwhile, scientists detect extraterrestrial attempts to scan the planet, and they raise a jamming barrier just in case. At first the jamming barrier has holes -- a few choice places on the planet where ancient designs turn out to be docking sites for space elevators. A few extraterrestrial beings manage to beam themselves onto these docking sites before the holes in the jamming barrier are sealed. Undercover, they try to study the world's technology and send reports home.

Just before the aliens can schedule the reinitialization of the planet, the original trines manage to use their goodun/badun control technology to break through the sky, into the surrounding space colony. Seeing this, the aliens decide the planet should remain indefinitely, and they reupload themselves to the space colony in peace.

### Plot ongoing

The trines are adventurous, making it a competition to see who can visit more alien worlds first. Wherever they go, they bring their goody/baddy mayhem with them, and this isn't always synergistic with the planet's own customs.

The trines don't have access to the entire galactic orrery complex at once, but they can see quite a lot of it when they look out the window. Unbeknownst to them (but eventually suspected), not only is their own planet an experiment, but also their local solar system, the local constructed system of solar systems, and so on. Even the aliens who visited their planet are only locals of the solar system.

#### Milly and Lilly's headcanon

In the continuity of link:anthology-plot.asc[Home], where Milly and Lilly live, Goody-Goody Goodies is one of their favorite TV shows... or at least they like the first season of it. They regularly visit the Goody-Goody Goodies continuity using their VR units, and they orchestrate events in their favor, making sure in particular that the lighthearted dynamic of the first season is never lost.

The show itself accomplishes mass appeal on Home in part because it doesn't take a side between the lesbian and gay worlds. All characters are gender-ambiguous, and all potential pairings therefore appear to be same-sex, so they're equally unchallenging to lesbian and gay viewers. Meanwhile, the goody/baddy divide acts as a light satire of the gender-divided society, where the feminism struggles and political party struggles are all too easily correlated with gender.

Milly and Lilly read lots of erotic Goody-Goody Goodies fanfics, and they reenact them in VR. In the process, they sometimes impose Home-like gender roles whether they realize it or not. On the other hand, they don't impose homonormativity as such; fanfic in the Home continuity is often heteroerotic, and fanfic for Goody-Goody Goodies sometimes gets especially creative. There are fanfic authors who imagine GGG eroticism to be telepathic, spiritual, subatomic, digital, etc. Some of these may even be contradicted outright by later seasons of the TV show, to be kept alive only by stubborn fans like Milly and Lilly themselves.
