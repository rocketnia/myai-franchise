## Goody-Goody Goodies

#### World

For thousands of eons, life has gone on. Life has built itself up to become the galactic orrery complex, a giant web of space elevators and Dyson spheres that adaptively harness the power of planets, stars, and black holes to provide power to its mechanical and maintenance infrastructure. Meanwhile, it constructs various experimental biospheres, planets, and planetary systems inhabited by humans, which it adaptively harnesses to provide its intelligence infrastructure.

On a certain planet, unaware of the galactic orrery complex, every person is given an alignment at birth: They're a goody, or they're a baddy. At this time, they're assigned to a trine of three babies of the same alignment, and the three babies are given simple names suiting their trine. Trines grow up as family, though usually with the help of a mature trine or two. Babies are also given a gauntlet that measures their subatomic goodun and badun affinity, which they wear throughout their lives. This objectivity helps keep goodies or baddies from pursuing philosophical equivocations that stage them as the superior side.

It's not infrequent for someone to have trouble maintaining their goodun-badun ratio according to their alignment, but this is often dismissed as economic hardship; the economy strongly favors those who have good scores on their gauntlets. Still, there are people who seek an alignment transition or who would like to reject the notion of alignment altogether. These people are called wishy-washies, and the ones who manage to make a living in spite of their condition (washies) are respected, especially in leadership positions which need to oversee both baddies and goodies fairly. Washies sometimes favor other wishy-washies inequitably or have sympathy for wishy aid programs, but they also try to keep this tendency in check. It's common sense idea that gooduns and baduns must stay in tense rivalry.

Young adults of ages 17-24 engage in sanctioned tomfoolery so that this subatomic rivalry can be cultivated. They go to live in isolated biospheres where goodies and baddies live in a well-mixed checkerboard of dwellings, with various manufactured temptations to pursue in between. Some regions of the biosphere are heavily forested, but others have more of a village, strip mall, or hard labor aesthetic. Participants are encouraged to form clubs to study any topics of interest to them, and they're especially encouraged to hold contests.

#### Things that are not in the world

Violence is never a problem. The people of this world have some amount of toon physics on their side. If they fall off a cliff, they'll find themselves walking around in a cast for a short while, and then they'll be good to go again.

There is no notion of masculinity or femininity, and all characters appear androgynous. The only third-person pronoun is "they," but repeating someone's name is preferred when possible. Names are chosen to be succinct enough to do this comfortably: Door, Hinge, and Jam, for instance.

Sexuality is not really part of the culture at all. Sex is something that can happen, but it's not something anyone would think to do -- not for pleasure, not for marketing, and not for harm. Even if someone discovered sexual stimulation by accident, they would soon mysteriously forget about it.

Precisely because of the lack of significance of gender and sex, sometimes people do things that we would consider gendered or sexual. Our viewpoint imposes inevitable bias: Either the story silently stays within the boundaries of what we expect, or it isn't palatable to us, or it explicitly lampshades our viewpoint so that the events can continue being independent of it. Goody-Goody Goodies will tend to err toward the latter.

#### Plot

The story begins in a single biosphere, following some new arrivals as they begin their adventures. It's a light situational comedy.
