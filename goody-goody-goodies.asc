## Goody-Goody Goodies

#### World

For thousands of eons, life has gone on. Life has built itself up to become the galactic orrery complex, a giant web of space elevators and Dyson spheres that adaptively harness the power of planets, stars, and black holes to provide power to its mechanical and maintenance infrastructure. Meanwhile, it constructs various experimental biospheres, planets, and planetary systems inhabited by humans, which it adaptively harnesses to provide its intelligence infrastructure.

One of those biospheres is the setting of this story.
