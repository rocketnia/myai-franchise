(Watch out for spoilers!)

## MyAI (the story-hopping anthology)

#### Plot

In the Home continuity, Lilly meets Milly while on a spy mission, and the two of them take down a presidential conspiracy. When it's all over, they go off to live together under the radar, but they receive a mysterious package with a baby (Max) and two VR pods.

In the Isle B continuity, Yeoman appears out of nowhere. He meets Celeprater, and the two of them encounter Milly and Lilly. Lilly is being more promiscuous than Milly's heart can take. As Yeoman talks to their various victims to clean up the messes they leave, Milly finds a way to confront Milly and rekindle their romance.

In the Home continuity, middle schooler Max has a heartbreaking run-in with a friend-who-is-a-girl, and Milly and Lilly realize he's straight. Milly works as a voice actress on the show "Magical Radia," which she tries to use as a platform for positive representation of straight people for Max's sake. Lilly finds she needs to get back in touch with her real-world friends rather than losing herself in VR.

Milly and Lilly prepare a birthday surprise to say farewell to Yeoman: Another character related to him, Shinx. Shinx takes Yeoman on a visit to the link:mega-mega-megan.asc[Mega Mega Megan] continuity to watch the story crumble when link:story-about-that.asc[Chaozer] invades and steals the main character. Shinx uses this as an argument for the evil of story-hopping and the necessity of bringing everyone's story to a fitting resolution, and he tries to persuade Yeoman into committing suicide. Yeoman is too cheerful and illogical for that; he even jumps into the falling-apart scene to give the characters a new conflict to sustain their story. Shinx expresses surprise and anger, and he self-destructs, attempting to catch Yeoman in the blast.

Yeoman is shocked, but he resolves to create a story for himself. He kidnaps 19-year-old Max to use as a sidekick, without knowing Max was Milly and Lilly's son.

Yeoman takes Max to the Convention continuity. Max meets several characters at once, and his effortless ability to win game show games enrages his fellow contestants Mary and Sue. Max has nightmares about the planet Home being destroyed.

Yeoman takes Max to a few of Max's favorite continuities, but if Yeoman won't take Max to the Poachers continuity, Max just wants to go home. Yeoman finally obliges by taking him home, but Mary and Sue appear and destroy the planet. Max can't stand the thought of being a main character, and if he can't escape his tormentors Yeoman, Mary, and Sue, he wants to focus his blame on the author.

While tensions run high, Yeoman continues to take Max on adventures on various continuities as they figure out ways to deal with Mary and Sue. Finally, they go to a high-libido continuity and let Mary and Sue's animosity play out against each other for a while. That being a rather horrifying experience, Max and Yeoman take a break in the Mega Fan continuity, which Yeoman thinks might be his home. Mary and Sue once again show up in a rage, and Max watches with an utter lack of sympathy as they execute Yeoman.

Left to his own devices, Max decides to go to the Poachers continuity. However, one of his Poachees turns out to be Yeoman in disguise, which throws him for a loop. In his angst, every night Max thinks about how his time in the Poachers universe is supposed to be, and every morning he wakes up to a completely different parody or reinterpretation of the show.

Meanwhile, Yeoman actually wasn't quite Yeoman after all. He was Yeo.EXE, the godlike collective reincarnation of twenty four versions of Yeoman, including Shinx. Yeoman and Shinx work out their own issues in their collective mind, while Shinx pilots their body in an attempt to track down and manipulate Mary and Sue.

Mary has been unable to log out of VR ever since the encounter in the high-libido continuity. It turns out she's pregnant.

Max finally gets fed up with the various parodies, and he goes far back in time to orchestrate the course of history in the Poachers continuity himself. He sets up a corporate empire that experiments with Poachees and Poachee-related technology, including the experiments that lead to the creation of Celeprater.

However, after Max has lived through a couple of decades as a bigwig, a person claiming to be the author appears and fights her way through the ranks of the corporation. She confronts Max and convinces him this was all a mistake. Max travels back to just before he started orchestrating history this way, and he encourages his former self to take a different path.

Hearing this message from his future self, Max finds himself back in the version of the Poachers continuity that he first visited. There, Shinx has Mary and Sue as his lackeys, and Max is just what they were waiting for. Shinx threatens the characters of the Poachers continuity as a way to manipulate Max into using his own luck to take everyone to Sue's continuity. Fortunately, between Yeoman's respect for Shinx, Max's forgiveness of Yeoman, and the new attitude Mary and Sue have in light of Mary's pregnancy and their fourth wall breaking, Shinx doesn't get very far before he resigns to let Yeoman take control.

Mary has her child, but she and Sue don't really understand how they can care for it when they're just young adults themselves. Meanwhile, Max loses his luck; the baby is him, and having two versions of himself makes his luck cancel out.

Max, Yeo.EXE, Mary, Sue, and the baby find themselves being followed by a gang of disgruntled characters from continuities they had visited before. These characters have amassed enough story-hopping technology and enough continuity-specific deus ex machinas to be a threatening force of their own. And these characters have in turn been followed by Milly, Lilly, and Celeprater.

As they try to figure out how to deal with the havoc, Milly, Lilly, Mary, Sue, Max, Yeo.EXE, Celeprater, and the baby set up a home base at the Convention universe and collaborate with whatever characters they can.

At some point, the baby and two VR units are sent back in time, where they will be cared for by the younger Milly and Lilly. Two VR units are also given to the past versions of Mary and Sue.
