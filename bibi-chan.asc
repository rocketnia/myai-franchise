## Bibi-chan

#### Plot

The empire of Queen Ratched is a happy place to live... but someone has to do the work! Bibi is a pink mailbox-shaped delivery bot, the only one of her kind. She visits various parts of the empire to assist their local nobility with logistical issues that they're having trouble dealing with themselves: She clears logs that have crossed the road, rebuilds the fences of the rabbot hutches, helps civilians evacuate from disaster zones, and generally fixes up messes.

In the climax, Queen Ratched is throwing a party to celebrate the prosperity of the empire, inviting nobility from all around, but several pieces of the party planning are going wrong. Bibi-chan has to do her part to make things go smoothly.

#### Gameplay

Several of Bibi-chan's missions involve clearing a path from one duchy to another. These paths are blocked by things like natural obstructions, animal-bot migrations, and angry neighbors. The world map gradually opens up as these obstacles are cleared, allowing more levels to be selected.

In each level, Bibi-chan can walk around, ride moving platforms (no jumping), climb ropes, push boxes, and flip switches. The switches can move obstructions. Most levels contain bots who follow predictable behaviors, which often interact with other bots or items in the level. Sometimes an NPC in the level acts as the switch, and speaking to them will give you a hint on how to persuade them. Each level may have one or more exit doors, which unlock certain paths of the world map. At any time, Bibi-chan may exit a level or restart it.

Bibi-chan carries an inventory of simple items, which she can obtain from certain levels and bring out in specific circumstances. Many times, an NPC will want an item as proof of a task's completion.

There are no irreversible choices in the game. The player has a choice of what paths to take through the world map first, and they may play the ending of the game before they complete every mission, but at no time can they miss out on content by making the wrong choice.
