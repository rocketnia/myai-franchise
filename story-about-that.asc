## Story about That

#### Plot, Characters, and Relationships

There are originally four main characters: Chaozer and the team of three known as the Jawbreakers.

*Chaozer* - As far as the Jawbreakers can tell, Chaozer was originally a personification of a concept of a reflective tower, cumulative type theory, prophecy, and/or innate existence. In every story continuity they have observed (though they may have selection bias), if a fictional character has a route to become incarnated as a real person, then Chaozer knows how to incarnate himself this way. Chaozer monologues melodramatically (but unreliably!) about his plans, which sometimes involve serious harm to people and entire continuities. His claimed goal is to destroy the world so thoroughly that there isn't any memory of it. However, the Jawbreakers soon come to believe it makes more sense to think of Chaozer as a force of nature.

*The Frond* - He dresses in dark clothes and sunglasses that on anyone else would look cool. However, he does this out of an intent to hide his art style from alternate-art-style extrafictionals who would recognize something amiss in his appearance. To determine Chaozer's plans, he socializes with extrafictionals to get information about the predominant theories of abstraction and incarnation in their continuity.

*Luisa* - She has a punkish no-makeup style but has a laid-back attitude. She's a bookworm, role-playing GM, and writer, and in the field she takes the initiative to prepare magic spells and construct battle plans.

*Marcel* - He has long, slicked-back hair and a T-shirt and jeans style. He carries the detector device that the team uses for various... detection purposes. Being from a continuity that doesn't take itself very seriously, the scope of knowledge Marcel and his device have is rather illogical. Marcel is always eager to share knowledge with the team.

The Frond and Luisa - These two are often paired up in the field while Marcel is tinkering.

Luisa and Marcel - These two enjoy playing games with each other.

The Frond and Marcel - These two have some questionable chemistry: Marcel is eager to help out, but the Frond gets embarrassed easily.

Partway through the plot, Chaozer has surpassed the Jawbreakers' abilities so thoroughly that they're little more than a joke. In one of his characteristically inscrutable stunts to manipulate the reception of the current story in the next extrafiction, he visits link:mega-mega-megan.asc[the Mega Mega Megan continuity] and yanks out the main character.

*Mega Mega Megan* - She and her brother Darren (currently trapped in a game she carries in her inventory) have a special ability to enter into fictional worlds when they fight with each other. Megan abused her brother and is used to taking whatever she wants by force. In her violence she's very willing to go through pain, but she does stop short of seriously injuring herself. Chaozer is now a force she can't defeat through simple violence, and together with the Jawbreakers she has a chance to learn another way of seeing the world.

*Darren* - Although he comes along for the ride with Megan, his trapped status makes him unlikely to impact the story much. However, he is important as an aspect of Megan's backstory, and Megan's story-entering ability depends on her relationship with Darren. Personality-wise, Darren's actions fall into a pattern of abuse he learned from Megan, but unlike Megan he focuses it mainly on one person, her. Rather than direct violence, he prefers to set things up so his adversaries will destroy themselves.

*Bibi-chan* - Megan still wears the pink jumpsuit and yellow goggles of Bibi-chan, granting her armor and weaponry of sorts. If she were to take it off, Bibi-chan could become her own robot again. Bibi-chan is a friendly public servant, but due to Megan she has been taken on an eye-opening ride through the ugly bowels of the saccharine empire she called home, and she has a lot to think about.

The Frond and Mega Mega Megan - Megan insists on putting the Frond into situations that embarrass him. She's even willing to use his art style as shock value to get extrafictionals riled up. However, the Frond likes being able to be more true to himself, and he forms a crush on Megan.

Luisa and Mega Mega Megan - Luisa had thought of herself as the butch one of the group, and Megan has taken her schtick. Luisa has better plan-making skills than Megan does, while Megan is braver. Luisa and Megan bond over their competitiveness and learn to have each other's back.

Marcel and Mega Mega Megan - Marcel is simply abused by Megan, and they have bad rapport. Marcel can often work through it by talking with Luisa, but sometimes he's tempted to side with Chaozer or Darren when he needs urgent help. Unlike Darren, Marcel has a rather cheery stock personality that was written to resist hardship, and his life experiences are only recently being tainted by Megan, so he has both his genre and his conscious thoughts on his side.

The addition of Mega Mega Megan to the Jawbreakers team does something special for them: It gives them a main character figure, around which they can fall into easy support roles: The Frond is a love interest, Luisa is a stern mentor-protector, and Marcel is a walking encyclopedia. Previously these archetypes had been more distributed through the team.

While Megan and Darren's interference had transformed link:bibi-chan.asc[the story of Bibi-chan] from a hero's journey into a hopeless rampage, now it transforms Story about That from a hopeless rampage into a hero's journey. Unfortunately, in the Jawbreakers' line of work, hero's journeys are frequent and short-lived, and the team probably couldn't hold a candle to Chaozer even if they enjoyed playing foil to Megan.
